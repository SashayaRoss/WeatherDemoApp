# WeatherDemoApp
Experimenting with SwiftUI.
This app has been developed exclusively for the purpose of honing SwiftUI skills through the practical application of building a simple app.

## (WIP) Features
Display current weather for user's location: temperature, wind speed, max and min temperature that day and map weather code to appropriate icon. 
In the bottom widget: use buttons to either display temperature and weather icon for next days or for the next hours during the day.

Uses open-meteo api for data.
